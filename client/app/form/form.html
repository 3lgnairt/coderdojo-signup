            <h4>Info:</h4>

            <p>The first Girls only Coder Dojo Event at Bankwest, consisting of only female mentors and female ninjas, will be held on Monday 5 October, 2015
                from 10:00am to 3:00pm at Bankwest Place located in the Perth CBD. During that time period the ninjas will get to choose from a number of different
                stations where they can build and program robots, create websites or animate scenes and create games. At the end of the event we will
                be holding a showcase, where the ninjas get to show off the amazing things they created. The event will include morning tea and afternoon snacks
                but please be advised that all ninjas and parents or guardians who may be accompanying them are expected to bring their own lunch.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be providing laptops but if a ninja has a laptop they would like to use, they are welcome to bring it. However, please note that we may
                not have a way for the ninja to participate to show off their work in the showcase if they are using their own laptop. They may want to bring a
                VGA adaptor if they have one.
